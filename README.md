# Welcome to my Memory Game Project

This small project was created to make users enjoy and test their memory.
This game called **Memory Game**

### What does it contain

First of all after openning the page you will be able to see :

* a Title : it's just to say hi.
* a Bar : it contains a :
	1. Three stars for rating the performance of your playing.
	2. a Counter that will count your moves and help rating your performance.
	3. a Timer that will show you time you have spent on playing.
	4. a Replay symbol to restart the game whenever you want.
* a Board that contains the cards of play.

### How does it works

The cards are randomly selected, and it's first state is closed card.
whenever you make the first click the timer will start.
when you click on a card it will open and let you see the content of it, it remains opened until you click on other card, so here are tow cases :
1. case 1 : the cards have the same content so both of cards will remain opened and one move will count.
2. case 2 : the cards doesn't match so the both of cards will return to their closed state, but they will remain in their positions, and one move will count.

when you succeed opening the last tow cards a congratiolation message will shown and it have some information about your performance and the time you spent to finish the whole game.
